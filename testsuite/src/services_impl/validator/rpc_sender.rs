This entire file is copied from https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/client/src/rpc_request.rs
because solana-client provides Ledger support, which means it has a dependency
on the 'hidapi' kernel module. This module won't compile under Docker-for-Mac
due to https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5295
Therefore, we reimplement parts of the Solana client here as a hackaround
